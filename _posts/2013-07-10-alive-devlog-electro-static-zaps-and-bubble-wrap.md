This post is brought to you by subliminal digital messages.

The button ui is integrated with player upgrades (abilities) now,with accompanying high-grade transparent-free icons. You don't get much better than those.

Rewrote the ui module (that is the thing draws buttons on the bright box in front of you). There was some code reshuffle and optimizations. The simple answer? It just feels better.

You can switch to any other AI, controlling them and their upgrades. Animated transisitions are smooth like soya cream.

All engine related stuff, not much of gameplay. These additions paves the way for ranged attacks and passive abilities.
