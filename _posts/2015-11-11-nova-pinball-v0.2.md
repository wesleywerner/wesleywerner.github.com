Changes in this version:

* Balance the left and right ramp angles. Play feels more fluid now with both ramps being equal in size.
Reduce the Fusion mission wait times.
* Activate ball Safe Mode on first launch (Safe mode is a 30 second grace period where a free ball is given on a drain)
* Activate safe mode during the wormhole mission.
* Fix a bug where a tilt did not reset on a drain if Safe Mode is on.
* Optimization: Pre-draw walls onto a canvas.
* Replace the slingshot indicator lights with flashing chevrons.
* Reworked the table to be less tall. It is now easier to reach the top targets.
* Add a rate limiter of 60 fps.
