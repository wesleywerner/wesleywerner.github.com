Today we draw the play area onto the main screen.

We fixed some line wrapping issues, and a panel to draw the player stats.

The UI button library I wrote for PyGame works well, I added tooltips to it too.

Today also saw our game state machine coming alive. We use a stack-based machine, I love this technique for tracking game states, since forever.

In between the code and the pixel hacking, is writing todo and spec texts.
