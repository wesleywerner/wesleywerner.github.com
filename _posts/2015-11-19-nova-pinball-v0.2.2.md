* Faster flipper movement. Now we are playing!
* Get more points when hitting targets and completing missions.
* A better layout: the ramps are now symmetrical, more fluid play.
* Highlight the status bar while the ball saver (safe mode) is on.
* Music! Thanks goes to `Beyond` for the theme song "Supernova Explosion"!
* Music controls on the pause screen, including a separate volume control.
* Bug fix: Reset tilt on first launch. If the previous game ended on Tilt it would carry over to the new game.

V0.2.2.1 bug fix: Fix bug where changing music volume during fade-out crashes.
