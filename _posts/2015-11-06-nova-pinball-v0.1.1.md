* Space flippers apart. The ball can now fall through the gap between the flippers.
* Space the top bumpers down, and out. There is more movement between the bumpers and the word targets.
* Make the ball bounce off gates when it is slingshot up the ramps. This means after being shot up the ramps, it will bounce and fall on to different word targets, and not always the same target.
