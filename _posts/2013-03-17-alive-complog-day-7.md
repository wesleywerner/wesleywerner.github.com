The last day is here. We still need to implement all the player special abilities, and create all the map levels and code in the storyline, and combat balancing.

### What got done

Game state and map rendering, player and random npc movement. Game dialogs and basic melee combat.

### Where I failed

Field of vision, npc path finding, many maps (pre-built maps, not generated), storyline, balancing npc stats, special player abilities, upgrading player abilities.

### What I discovered

*   My previous 2 entries used ascii symbols, this allowed for more time working on the code. I spent much time pixeling the tileset. I love pixel drawings but admittedly suck at them.
    
*   pygame supports playing .s3m, .xm, .it, .mod files :\]
    
*   you can get away with sleeping 1 hour power naps every 6 hours over 48 hours (or longer)
