# About

Hello, I am Wesley. I am a software developer and computer systems architect by trade, with a focus on high-end business applications. I have over two decades of experience in the field, building and maintaining enterprise-level desktop and web applications. But it provides very little creative outlet.

This site is a portfolio of some of my more creative, hobbyist projects. I hope it provides you with a good distraction.
