A tiny Lua 5.x compatible library to easily add A* path finding to any project. 

The repository includes an example created in [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), unit tests and a performance profiler.

The path finding is super fast, averaging 16 milliseconds to find a path on a map with 9 million locations, with about 65% open space.
