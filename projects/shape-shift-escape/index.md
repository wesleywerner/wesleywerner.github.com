This is a point-and-click adventure game created using the [SLUDGE game engine](https://opensludge.github.io/). Sound effects were generated with SFXR, Pixel art by myself.

The game was made for Ludum Dare #33, 2015.

The "GNU / Linux" version requires you to install SLUDGE via your repository. The Win32 version (for Windows) contains the executable to play the game.
