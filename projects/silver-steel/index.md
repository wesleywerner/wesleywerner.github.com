> A freelance spy is a great job. It pays well and you get to travel to new and interesting places. Unless you get caught, that part is not so great. You open the unmarked envelope and unfold the mission briefing enclosed within: Infiltrate MegaCorp, gain access to the data centre, download the database. So here you are, standing in the foyer of MegaCorp, disguised as a repairman.

You can download the story file (zblorb or z8) or play in your browser.
