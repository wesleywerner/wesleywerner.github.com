Desktop PC Instructions
-----------------------

To play the story you need a Z-Machine interpreter. You can use [Gargoyle](http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/).

You can also [play it online](https://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fcompetition2020%2FGames%2FDr%2520Ego%2520and%2520the%2520egg%2520of%2520ManToomba%2FDrEgoAdv.z5). To save your progress type "SAVE".

Android Mobile Instructions
---------------------------

I suggest using the [Text Fiction](https://textfiction.onyxbits.de/) mobile app.

- Install Text Fiction
- Download the z5 story file from your phone
- Open the Text Fiction app
- Tap the three-dot menu icon then tap Import

Text Fiction auto saves your progress. To resume your story, tap the game menu (+ icon) then tap `Restore`.

The online version is playable on mobile but can be a frustrating experience, and saving progress does not work on mobile.
